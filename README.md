# GSS-Immigrant-Attitudes

What is the heterogeneity between immigrant confidence toward host societiesâ€™ educational institutions from native-born citizens based on their level of educational attainment?

In this research I will examnine the relationship between immigrant's confidence in the United Sates' educational institutions against native-born citizens based on their educational attainment. My hypothesis for this reserach will be that "Immigrants in the United States will have higher confidence in education for the United States if they have high educational attainment in comparision to native-born United States citizens".

It is generally accepted that immigrants have more confidence in the three branches of the goernment than even native born United States citizens, according to Alex Nowrasteh and Andrew C. Forrester (2019). Coupled with the data collected by Pew Reserach Center (2022) that highlightes how the United States have a general higher institutional attitude rating by other countries, it can be surmised that the genearl attitude of most immigrants from other countries should follow a similar stance and have a (more or less) positive attitude toward the United States' and its institutions. From personal anecdotal experiences as well, a country's institutional attitude toward the United States will drastically shape the way a country's portrayal of the United States in their own educational system. In China, for example, the United States are often described as "greedy", "capitalist", "violent", and "corrupt" in the textbooks. As highlighted by Shannon Schumacher, most immigrants came to the U.S. to seek better work and educational opportunities as well as a better future for their children with more rights and freedoms (2023). This makes sense: if one has a general negative attitude toward the United States, there would be little reason for them to seek immigration to the United States. I would argue that since most immigrants in the United States are here to seek better life chances (which is dependent upon them having a good impression of the United States) and the fact that most countries generally have a good attitude towards the United States, immigrant respondets' educational level and their status as immigrants will make them more confident in the educational system of the United States.

As such, I predict that immigrants in the United States will have higher confidence in education for the United States if they have high educational attainment in comparision to native-born United States citizens
